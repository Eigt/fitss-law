This application was used in a visuomotor adaption experiment for a psychomotor class at a university.
The user controls a red dot cursor with their mouse. 
They are asked to move the cursor up to the cross-shaped target at the top of the screen and click when the cursor nears the center of the target.
Then, they are asked to return the cursor to the starting box at the bottom of the screen.
The user is expected to maintain constant motion. Clicking precisely on the target is not necessary.
In Stage 1, the user repeats this up-and-down motion several times.
In Stage 2, the motion is disrupted by deviating the cursor horizontally as it moves vertically. This forces the user to adapt their own motion.
In Stage 3, the deviation ceases, forcing the user to re-adapt to the "normal" up-and-down movement.
At the end of Stage 3, the app outputs a series of vectors that the user may place in a graph.
